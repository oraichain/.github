IBC-enabled Layer 1 to verify multidimensional trustworthiness of AI and to build Web3 applications with unique AI Oracle™.

Docs for the network can be found at [docs.orai.io](https://docs.orai.io/). Some repositories of interest:

## IBC layer 1

- [oraibridge](https://github.com/oraichain/gravity-bridge) - Multichain evm-based (included tron network) to cosmos bridge, act as Oraichain subnetwork.
- [universal-swap](https://github.com/oraichain/ibc-bridge-wasm) - Single step operation to swap tokens between evm-based chains and cosmos-based chains.

## Cosmwasm ecosystem

- [orai](https://github.com/oraichain/orai) - A cosmos-sdk based framework that support multiversion of cosmwasm, and zkVm to scale your dApp and reduce costs on L2 without compromising on security, by facilitating zero knowledge proofs.
- [cw-simulate](https://github.com/oraichain/cw-simulate) - An online playground / simulation environment for interacting with CosmWasm contract binaries without a blockchain. Can be used for execution visualization / interactive debugging with time-traveling navigation, and testing framework that is compatible with CosmWasm/ts-codegen output.

## JS tooling

- [cwtools](https://github.com/oraichain/cosmwasm-tools) - A super fast and cross-platform alternative to rust-optimizer that produces optimized wasm files. Written in Typescript, supporting watch mode, parallel builds, and ts-codegen sharing common dependencies.
- [cosmwasm-studio ](https://github.com/oraichain/smart-studio) - Monaco IDE that supports CosmWasm. It allows developers to code, build smart contracts and execute functions through a simulation. It supports its own rust-analyzer in Web Assembly so developers can code it the same as local VS Code.
